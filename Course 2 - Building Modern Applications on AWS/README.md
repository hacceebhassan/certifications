# Building Modern Python Applications on AWS

Building Modern Python Applications on AWS explores how to build an API driven application using Amazon API Gateway for serverless API hosting, AWS Lambda for serverless computing, and Amazon Cognito for serverless authentication. It follows an API driven development process and first mock up what the API will look like. It covers all the ins and outs of the service Amazon API Gateway, and it does a lot more than just hosting an API.
