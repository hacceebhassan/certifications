## About this Course

This specialization is designed to help master the skills of designing and building cloud-native applications on AWS. It begins with the foundational technical and cloud knowledge that need to have to build in the AWS Cloud. In the first course,there will be introduction to several AWS compute services, different storage and database offerings that AWS provides, AWSâ€™ networking capabilities, monitoring capabilities and the AWS IAM service.

The second course of the specialization explores how to build an API driven application using Amazon API Gateway for serverless API hosting, AWS Lambda for serverless computing and Amazon Cognito for serverless authentication.

Modern applications require a modern database. Hence, the third course introduces to NoSQL databases and the challenges they solve. This will dive deep into Amazon DynamoDB topics such as recovery, SDKs, partition keys, security and encryption, global tables, stateless applications, streams, and best practices. DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale.

Finally, it'll exhibit how to use Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer to detect issues and identify recommendations to improve the quality and security of the code.
